## __About Me__
My name is Dmitriy. I am 27 years old. I am worked at Astravec nuclear power plant as an engineer about 2 years and was disappointed my profession. Thinking about a new profession and on the advice of friends, I decided to try myself in Internet Technologies. I started by writing simple programs on JS and I liked it, now my goal is to become a developer. I entered in BSU for retraining on a programmer-web-designer, where I learned the basics of web-site development from writing technical specifications to implementation and promotion, but rather superficially. At this stage, I want to focus on development, improve my knowledge and get practical experience for employment and subsequent self-realization as a cool and in-demand developer.
